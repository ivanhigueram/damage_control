# Damage control: Clean traces from social media (mainly Twitter)

[![Trigger twitter deleter using a CRON
job](https://github.com/ivanhigueram/damage_control/actions/workflows/scheduled-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ivanhigueram/damage_control/actions/workflows/scheduled-build.yml)

This repo runs a cronjob to delete and backup tweets yearly from my personal
account. The execution relies on Github actions to connect to the API, delete
tweeets under the desired timeframe and then backup to `backups` as a SQLite
dataset. 

The Github actions do a self-push on the backups only if there are changes on
the tables. Ideally, I should have done a schema and do not allow repetition on
commit, but lazyness. 

## Configuration and use

Twitter has become annoying with their API use. To successfully use this code
you will need *Elevated* API access; the default app permissions are *Essential*
only. The application to these permissions is straight-forward, but adds to the
process. API permissions need two sets of keys (key + secret): `API_KEY` and
`ACCESS_TOKEN`. These keys must be stored as environment variables. 

Once keys are stored, you can execute `purge_tweets`. This function takes
several options to decide what to delete and other options you can check out on
the function's doctring. The `plot.py` (ironically not a plot generator
function) creates a JSON file to be rendered in this README file.  

## Year summary

This is an autogenerated summary of the tweet database. The table will be
activated once the `purge` action in done.

### To-do
 - [ ] Add Mastodon (:elephant:)
 - [ ] Find other things to nuke (i.e. RTs, favorite tweets, bookmarks, etc.)
 - [ ] Add cute-r stuff to summarize data (a Github page, maybe)
 - [ ] Add pre-commit to apply `black` on each commit because of course, *antes
   muerta que sencilla*.
